# -CalculatorUI
play with IOS UI constraints in different screen configurations
*) compact/regular in vertical/horizontal for landscape/portrait mode
*) build shit as much as reusable in wAny, hAny
*) assign constraints properly to wWhatever, hWhatever
*) when adding non-generic Views, make the constraints not affecting generic ones
